## Understanding Recommendations

### How Recommendations Work

Our AI considers multiple factors:

1. **Your Profile**: Risk tolerance, goals, experience
2. **Search History**: What you've looked for before
3. **Interactions**: Products you've viewed, saved, or rated
4. **Market Context**: Current rates, trends, and availability

### Match Scores

Each recommendation shows a match score:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90-100% | Excellent match for your profile |
| 70-89% | Good match with minor differences |
| 50-69% | Partial match, review carefully |
| Below 50% | Alternative option to consider |

### Understanding Explanations

Click "Why this recommendation?" to see:

- **Key Match Factors**: What makes this product right for you
- **Potential Concerns**: Things to consider
- **Comparison Points**: How it compares to alternatives

Example explanation:
```
This high-yield savings account is recommended because:
✓ Matches your low risk tolerance (FDIC insured)
✓ No minimum balance fits your flexible budget
✓ 4.5% APY exceeds current market average (4.2%)

Consider:
• Online-only bank (no physical branches)
• Rate may change with market conditions
```
